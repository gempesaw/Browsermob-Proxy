# NAME

Browsermob::Proxy - Perl client for the proxies created by the Browsermob server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gempesaw/Browsermob-Proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gempesaw/Browsermob-Proxy)

# VERSION

version 0.03

# SYNOPSIS

Standalone:

    my $proxy = Browsermob::Proxy->new(
        server_port => 9090
        # port => 9092
    );

    print $proxy->port;
    $proxy->new_har('Google');
    # create network traffic across your port
    $proxy->har; # returns a HAR as a hashref, converted from JSON

with [Browsermob::Server](https://metacpan.org/pod/Browsermob::Server):

    my $server = Browsermob::Server->new(
        server_port = 9090
    );
    $server->start; # ignore if your server is already running

    my $proxy = $server->create_proxy;
    $proxy->new_har('proxy from server!');

# DESCRIPTION

From [http://bmp.lightbody.net/](http://bmp.lightbody.net/): BrowserMob proxy is based on
technology developed in the Selenium open source project and a
commercial load testing and monitoring service originally called
BrowserMob and now part of Neustar.

It can capture performance data for web apps (via the HAR format), as
well as manipulate browser behavior and traffic, such as whitelisting
and blacklisting content, simulating network traffic and latency, and
rewriting HTTP requests and responses.

This module is a Perl client interface to interact with the server and
its proxies. It uses [Net::HTTP::Spore](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::HTTP::Spore). You can use
[Browsermob::Server](https://metacpan.org/pod/Browsermob::Server) to manage the server itself in addition to using
this module to handle the proxies.

# ATTRIBUTES

## server\_addr

Optional: specify where the proxy server is; defaults to 127.0.0.1

## server\_port

Optional: Indicate at what port we should expect a Browsermob Server
to be running; defaults to 8080

    my $proxy = Browsermob::Proxy->new(server_port => 8080);

## port

Optional: When instantiating a proxy, you can choose the proxy port on
your own, or let it automatically assign you a port for the proxy.

    my $proxy = Browsermob::Proxy->new(
        server_port => 8080
        port => 9091
    );

## trace

Set Net::HTTP::Spore's trace option; defaults to 0; set it to 1 to see
headers and 2 to see headers and responses. This can only be set during
construction.

    my $proxy = Browsermob::Proxy->new( trace => 2 );

# METHODS

## new\_har

After creating a proxy, `new_har` creates a new HAR attached to the
proxy and returns the HAR content if there was a previous one. If no
argument is passed, the initial page ref will be "Page 1"; you can
also pass a string to choose your own initial page ref.

    $proxy->new_har;
    $proxy->new_har('Google');

## har

After creating a proxy and initiating a `new_har`, you can retrieve
the contents of the current HAR with this method. It returns a hashref
HAR, and may in the future return an isntance of [Archive::HAR](https://metacpan.org/pod/Archive::HAR).

    my $har = $proxy->har;
    print Dumper $har->{log}->{entries}->[0];

## selenium\_proxy

Generate the proper capabilities for use in the constructor of a new
Selenium::Remote::Driver object.

    my $proxy = Browsermob::Proxy->new( server_port => 63638 );
    my $driver = Selenium::Remote::Driver->new( proxy => $proxy->selenium_proxy );
