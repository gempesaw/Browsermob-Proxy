# ABSTRACT: Perl client for the proxies created by the Browsermob server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $proxy = Browsermob::Proxy->new(
        server_port => 9090
        # port => 9092
    );

    print $proxy->port;
    $proxy->new_har('Google');
    # create network traffic across your port
    $proxy->har; # returns a HAR as a JSON blob

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of a Browsermob proxy that you can use to capture HARs,
filter traffic, limit network speeds, etc. This can be used completely
independently of L<Browsermob::Server> if you want to manage the
server separately.

If you are manually instantiating instances of this class, you must
specify the C<server_port> so we know where to find the
browsermob-proxy server.

=cut

=method get_ports

Get a list of ports attached to a ProxyServer managed by ProxyManager

    $proxy->get_proxies

=method create

Create a new proxy. This method is automatically invoked upon
instantiation, so you shouldn't have to call it unless you're doing
something unexpected.

=method delete_proxy

Shutdown the proxy and close the port. This is automatically invoked
when the C<$proxy> goes out of scope, so you shouldn't have to call
this either.

    $proxy->delete_proxy;

=method new_har

=attr port

Optional: When instantiating a proxy, you can choose the proxy port on
your own, or let it automatically assign you a port for the proxy.

=method new

Instantiate a new proxy. C<server_port> is a required argument; if
you're using C<BrowserMob::Server>, just invoke that class's
C<create_proxy> method.

    my $proxy = $bmp->create_proxy; # invokes new for you

    my $proxy = BrowserMob::Proxy->new(server_port => 63638);
